# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The watchlist button component has a reactivity bug where it fails to appear when a user transitions from an unauthenticated to authenticated state within the same session. Currently, the button only appears correctly after a page refresh when the user is already authenticated. This creates a poor user experience as users who log in during their session cannot immediately access watchlist functionality without refreshing the page.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who logs in during my browsing session, I want the watchlist button to immediately appear on auction item pages so that I can add items to my watchlist without needing to refresh the page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is viewing an auction item page in an unauthenticated state AND the user logs in THEN the watchlist button SHALL appear immediately without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN a user logs in from any page AND navigates to an auction item page THEN the watchlist button SHALL be visible
3. WHEN a user is authenticated AND viewing an auction item page THEN the watchlist button SHALL be visible and functional

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user who logs out during my browsing session, I want the watchlist button to immediately disappear from auction item pages so that the interface accurately reflects my authentication state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user is viewing an auction item page AND the user logs out THEN the watchlist button SHALL disappear immediately without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN a user logs out from any page AND navigates to an auction item page THEN the watchlist button SHALL not be visible

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the watchlist button's state and functionality to remain consistent regardless of how I became authenticated so that I have a reliable experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user becomes authenticated through any method (direct login, session restoration, etc.) THEN the watchlist button SHALL check and display the correct watchlist status for each item
2. WHEN the watchlist button appears after authentication state change THEN it SHALL correctly show whether the item is already in the user's watchlist
3. WHEN the watchlist button becomes functional after authentication THEN all watchlist operations (add, remove, status check) SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the watchlist button component to be reactive to authentication state changes so that it maintains consistency across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user authentication state changes THEN the watchlist button component SHALL reactively update its visibility
2. WHEN the authentication state changes THEN the component SHALL re-evaluate its conditional rendering logic
3. WHEN the component becomes visible due to authentication state change THEN it SHALL properly initialize its internal state (watchlist status, loading state, etc.)
