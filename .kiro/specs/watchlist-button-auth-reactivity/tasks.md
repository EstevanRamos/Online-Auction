# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Refactor watchlist button component for reactive authentication
  - Replace static conditional rendering with reactive visibility management using $derived
  - Implement $effect to watch authentication state changes and trigger component re-initialization
  - Add proper state reset logic when authentication state transitions occur
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 2. Implement reactive watchlist status checking
  - Create reactive watchlist status checking that triggers on auth state changes
  - Add proper initialization of watchlist state when component becomes visible after auth
  - Implement state cleanup and reset when user logs out or switches accounts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.3_

- [ ] 3. Add comprehensive error handling for auth state transitions
  - Implement error handling for watchlist status checks during auth transitions
  - Add graceful degradation when watchlist operations fail during state changes
  - Create proper error recovery mechanisms with user feedback
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 4. Create unit tests for authentication reactivity
  - Write tests for component visibility changes when userStore.isAuthenticated changes
  - Test component re-initialization when user logs in during session
  - Verify component properly hides when user logs out during session
  - Test watchlist state management during auth transitions
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 5. Implement integration tests for full authentication flow
  - Test complete login → watchlist button appears → functionality works flow
  - Test logout → watchlist button disappears flow
  - Verify multiple authentication events work correctly in same session
  - Test cross-component consistency when multiple watchlist buttons exist
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2_
